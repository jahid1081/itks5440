\line
\line \b Contents\b0
\line 1) A public CV web page (HTML5) hosted on GitHub Pages. Phone and street address were intentionally omitted.
\line 2) A single OWL file containing both the ontology (classes/properties imported from FOAF/Schema.org/DCTERMS) and the RDF data describing the student, organizations, roles, degrees, skills, languages, and publications.
\line 3) Outbound links to authoritative resources (university/school homepages, DBpedia/Wikidata where applicable, DOI pages for publications).
\line
\line \b Conclusion (Possible Uses)\b0
\line The RDF model enables machine-readable discovery and reuse of CV data. Applications can: link my identity to external datasets via \i schema:sameAs\i0; integrate employment and education records for search and analytics; and auto-generate or verify CV sections. Institutions can crawl the OWL file to pre-fill forms, and research indexes can resolve publication metadata via DOI identifiers. Keeping ontology and instance data in one file ensures resolvable IRIs and easy validation.

\line \b Notes\b0
\line - This report intentionally avoids private data.
\line - Replace <your-username> above with your GitHub username so that the base IRI matches the hosted file names.
